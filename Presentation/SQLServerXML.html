# Overview

1. What is XML?
2. XML Data Type in SQL
3. Querying XML with XQuery function 
4. Convert SQL into XML using XML FOR
5. Create XML Schema using XML FOR
6. Import XML into SQL using MERGE
7. **Bonus Round!** Turning multiple rows into comma delimited single row group using XML PATH! 
8. Summary

# What is XML? 

* XML stands for Extensible Markup Language

* The intent of XML is a universal and simple language that can describe data and objects across multiple environments

* It is hierarchical in nature with nodes represented as attributes or elements

* SSRS, SSIS and SSAS in SQL Server all use XML to encode their objects in their solution files

???

---

# What is XML? 

```XML
<!-- This is a comment node-->
<RootElementNode attribute="Root element attribute text">
  <ElementNode>Text node</ElementNode>
  <ElementNode>Text node 2
	<NestedNode>Nested Text Node</NestedNode>
  </ElementNode>
</RootElementNode>
```

* Above shows the hierarchical node layout of XML

* The outer most node in well-formed XML is the Root
 
* Those nodes in <> are called elements
	* The < is called a start tag and the > is called an end tag
	
* Those nodes where they’re attribute=“” are attributes

* XML can often be element-centric or attribute-centric


???

---

# What is XML? 

* Some well-formed XML 

* One or more elements, only one root element, and properly nested

```XML
<Hospital name="University Hospital of Wales">
  <Patient sex="M" name="Bill Withers" age="40">
    <Diagnosis>Diabetes</Diagnosis>
    <AdmissionDate>01-10-2014</AdmissionDate>
  </Patient>
  <Patient sex="F" name="April O'Neil" age="32">
    <Diagnosis>Broken Hip</Diagnosis>
    <AdmissionDate>15-12-2014</AdmissionDate>
  </Patient>
  <Patient sex="M" name="Bruce Wayne" age="38">
    <Diagnosis>Cholera</Diagnosis>
    <AdmissionDate>10-01-2015</AdmissionDate>
  </Patient>
</Hospital>
```

???

---

# What is XML? 

* An XML Fragment

* Same rules as well-formed XML, just no outer root node

```XML
<Patient sex="M" name="Bill Withers" age="40">
  <Diagnosis>Diabetes</Diagnosis>
  <AdmissionDate>01-10-2014</AdmissionDate>
</Patient>
<Patient sex="F" name="April O'Neil" age="32">
  <Diagnosis>Broken Hip</Diagnosis>
  <AdmissionDate>15-12-2014</AdmissionDate>
</Patient>
<Patient sex="M" name="Bruce Wayne" age="38">
  <Diagnosis>Cholera</Diagnosis>
  <AdmissionDate>10-01-2015</AdmissionDate>
</Patient>

```

# XML Data Type in SQL 


* There is now an XML data type in SQL
	(well there has been since 2005...)

* You can store this in a variable or in a column just like any other data type

* You can create schemas to validate your XML

* You can even create special XML indexes on your XML data type to aid in querying


???


---

# XQuery 

* **XML.Query()**
	* Allows you to query XML data type directly using a variety of syntax and functions
* **XML.Value()**
	* Allows you to retrieve a scalar value from XML data type and also used as part of Nodes() – see below
* **XML.Exists()**
	* Allows you to check whether particular value or node exists in the XML
* **XML.Nodes()**
	* Allows you to shred XML data into relational format


???


---

# FOR XML Option    

* FOR XML allows us to generate XML from a relational query

* Place them at the end of your query
	* SELECT col1, col2 FROM tab FOR **XML RAW**;
	* SELECT col1, col2 FROM tab FOR **XML AUTO**;
	* SELECT col1, col2 FROM tab FOR **XML PATH**;

* Often have parameters to customise your XML output

* One of these parameters allows the creation of an XML Schema to validate your XML against

???

---

# FOR XML Option    

* XML RAW
	* Default for XML RAW is to create single outer node with name of <row> with the columns generated in an attribute-centric format
* XML AUTO
	* Default for XML AUTO is to generate a single outer node with name of the table or alias with the columns generated in an attribute-centric format
	* Extra clause in XML AUTO using XMLSCHEMA allows generation of XML schema
	* Make sure your columns are in right hierarchical order!
* XML PATH
	* Default is similar to XML RAW except returns in element-centric format
	* However, this is the most customisable of the three options using alias syntax and parameters in the FOR clause

???

---

# Create XML Schema 

* You can use XML AUTO to generate an XML schema

* This schema can be stored as a variable and then created as an XML SCHEMA COLLECTION in your database

* This SCHEMA COLLECTION can then be added as part of your XML data type when used as a column or in a variable

* Prevents inserting XML data that doesn’t match the schema

???

---

# Import XML into SQL 

* You can directly access an XML file stored in a file architecture using OPENROWSET

* This XML can then be stored in a variable or table in SQL and queried using Xquery

* In this case we want to shred the XML immediately into relational format using nodes()

* Once we have shredded the data we can create a CTE around the output and MERGE into our relational table

???

---

# Quick side: MERGE

* Allows us to insert, update or delete all in one!

```SQL
MERGE INTO DestinationTable AS Tgt
USING SourceTable AS Src ON
src.KeyField = tgt.KeyField
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN 
	INSERT (Col1, Col2, Col3)
	VALUES (Col1, Col2, Col3)
WHEN MATCHED AND  
(
 	tgt.Col2 <> src.Col2 
	OR tgt.Col3 <>  src.Col3 
) THEN UPDATE 
	SET  tgt.Col2 = src.Col2 
	, tgt.Col3 =  src.Col3 
WHEN NOT MATCHED 
	THEN DELETE;
```

???

---

# Import XML into SQL 

* First import new data directly into blank table from XML file using the MERGE

* Second we show updating data from XML file using the same MERGE

* Adding a DELETE element allows us to delete data when the XML file tells us so as part of our MERGE statement logic

* XML is extremely flexible so you can add or remove elements easily

???

---

# Bonus Round 

* Can use XML to convert multiple-row data into a comma delimited row representation of the data

* Useful for where multiple values of the same thing per an event (e.g. Diagnosis and Procedures during an admitted stay)

* Best thing to do is take the logic and put it in a “common tools” repository as a function


???

---

# Summary 

* Should now understand the basic structure of XML

* Realise that there is an XML data type in SQL

* Can query XML directly in SQL using Xquery functions

* Easy to shred XML data from a file and MERGE into a SQL table

* Interesting uses of XML in SQL logic

# Now go Shred some XML!
